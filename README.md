# neuroimaging
Scripts for neuroimaging, written in Bash, Make and Matlab (including compiled Matlab).

The files were created while working on three main projects:

1) Exploring the relationship between long-range functional connectivity and local multi-voxel pattern analysis in resting-state fMRI.
...See the file IBIC_OHBM_Poster_Boord.pdf in this repository
2) Simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis
...See Research Proposal in this repository:
Research Proposal - Whole cortex mapping of neurovascular coupling in the resting brain for investigation of neurologic diseases.pdf
3) Attention network changes detected using fMRI in people with Parkinson's disease.
