# neuroimaging
Miscellaneous functions for neuroimaging, written in Bash, Make and Matlab (including compiled Matlab).

The files were created while working on three main projects:

1) Exploring the relationship between long-range functional connectivity and local multi-voxel pattern analysis in resting-state fMRI.
2) Simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis
3) Attention network changes detected using fMRI in people with Parkinson's disease.
